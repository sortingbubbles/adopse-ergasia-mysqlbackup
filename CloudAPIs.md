# Introduction #

The application must include the option to backup the selected databases to a cloud service or multiple cloud services. Therefore, there is the need to study and learn each cloud service's API, in order to be able to intergrade that feature.

# Details #

We, as a team, have decided to include the following cloud services as options for our users: **box**, **dropbox**, **google drive** and **onedrive**.
Each one of us must find the way to connect the application with (at least) one cloud service and deliver the necessary actions.

# Cloud Services #

**Box**

**Dropbox**

**Google drive**

**Microsoft onedrive**
The operation can be implemented with the Live SDK REST API.
